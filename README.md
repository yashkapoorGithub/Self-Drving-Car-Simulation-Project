# Self-Drving-Car-Simulator-Project

Self-Driving Car Simulator with CNN :
This project implements a self-driving car simulator using the Udacity Car Simulator and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for autonomous navigation. It allows you to train and test your own self-driving algorithms in a variety of simulated environments.
This project utilizes the Udacity Car Simulator for realistic and diverse scenarios and leverages a CNN architecture for perception and control learning.


Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: Refer to the requirements.txt file and install them using your preferred package manager.
3. Download the Udacity Car Simulator.
4. Run the simulator: Start the Udacity Car Simulator in either training or autonomous mode.
5. Train your CNN model (optional): See the train.py script for details on data collection and training configuration.
6. Test your self-driving car (autonomous mode): Run the drive.py script to see your trained model take control of the car.

Features:

1. Train on various environmental settings.
2. Customize the CNN architecture for different learning tasks.
3. Visualize and analyze training progress and performance.
